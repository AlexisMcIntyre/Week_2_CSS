            Ohayo gozaimasu! I went to Japan in 2009 with a small group of friends. We stayed in Tokyo and were able to 
            go to the country to visit my friend's relatives. What an interesting experience--being in Japan feels
            like you are on another planet. Everything down to the smallest detail is considered in design!
