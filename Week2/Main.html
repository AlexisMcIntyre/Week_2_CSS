        <!--I created a "box" class...very original. This was specifically for the main page text and some images, however, I was not successful getting the parts within this box to do what I wanted them to do, so I had to create another class below-->

            
            <p>

     some tips on what to visit and do! Boa viagem!!!

    <!--Here is the next "box" class I create, "boxwin". It was supposed to go inside of the box above, but I was not able to successfully do that. I still need to learn more about how to format within the containers.
    
    Anyway, I used this box to place my links to the other pages, and added some fun visual effects that you can see in my styles sheet.-->
